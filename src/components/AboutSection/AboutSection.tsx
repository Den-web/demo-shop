            Our brand was born from a love of comfort and a desire to create
            something special with our own hands. Each candle is the result of
            careful selection of natural ingredients, thoughtful craftsmanship,
            and a creative approach that turns simple moments into rituals of
            joy.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            We believe that scent has the power to transport us to cherished
            memories, peaceful places, or even inspire new beginnings. Thatâ€™s
            why every product is created with special attention to detail: from
            the choice of natural wax and eco-friendly wicks to the perfectly
            balanced fragrance blends.
